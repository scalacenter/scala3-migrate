# Scala 3 migration plugin for sbt

## User documentation

The complete documentation of `sbt-scala3-migrate` can be found in [docs.scala-lang.org](https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/guides/migration/scala3-migrate.html).

## Usage

### Requirements 
- sbt 1.5 or higher
- java 8 or 11
- scala 2.13, preferred 2.13.11

### Installation
```
// project/plugins.sbt
addSbtPlugin("ch.epfl.scala" % "sbt-scala3-migrate" % "0.4.6")
```

### Porting the build

To port a build to Scala 3, run the following commands in order, in each project of the build: 
- `migrateDepedendencies <project>` helps you update the list of `libraryDependencies`
- `migrateScalacOptions <project>` helps you update the list of `scalacOptions`
- `migrateSyntax <project>` fixes a number of syntax incompatibilities between Scala 2.13 and Scala 3 
- `migrateTypes <project>` tries to make your code compile with Scala 3 by infering a few types and resolving a few implicits.
